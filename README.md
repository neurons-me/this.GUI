# THIS.GUI
-----------
# Installation
Install `this.gui` via **npm**:
```shell
npm install this.gui
```
The goal is to automate the UI generation process so users only pass data or configurations, and this.gui handles the rest.

	1.	The user of this.gui doesn’t need to write React components themselves. They just pass configurations or data structures, and this.gui generates the UI dynamically.
	2.	React is still required in the user’s project because the UI components provided by this.gui are React components that need to be rendered by React.

The Key Value of this.gui:

	•	Simplifies UI creation: Users only pass configurations or data; they don’t need to deal with the intricacies of React.
	•	Dynamic generation: The components adapt and render based on the input you give them.
	•	Automation: You handle all the complexity of component creation, leaving users with a simplified interface to generate UIs.

Build the User’s App:
	•	When someone uses this.gui in their own application, they import this.gui and use it like any other dependency.
	•	They will then build their own application using their own bundler (such as Vite, Webpack, etc.). During this process, the bundler will include the components from this.gui as part of the final build.
	•	This app build step will include all the app’s code and the components from this.gui, and it will bundle everything into a final production build.
