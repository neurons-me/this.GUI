# Introduction

`this.gui` is a comprehensive UI toolkit for web development, providing both pre-styled components and customizable themes for building responsive and modern user interfaces for [all.this](neurons.me/this).

## Installation

Install `this.gui` via npm:

```shell
npm install this.gui
```

this.gui serve a dual purpose: one as a utility provider for GUI-related functionalities across your technologies and another as a data provider for neural networks. Let's break down how this.gui could serve these two roles:

GUI Provider (Utility Role): As a utility, this.gui can offer a consistent set of GUI components or services that other parts of your technology stack can use. This can include anything from standard UI elements to complex interaction patterns. By centralizing your GUI logic and components, you ensure consistency and reusability across your projects, which aligns well with it being categorized under utilities.

Data Provider for Neural Networks (Data Role): The more intriguing role of this.gui involves transforming GUI interactions or states into data that can be fed into neural networks. This can be achieved in several ways, depending on what aspects of the GUI you wish to analyze or learn from:

Interaction Data: Capturing user interactions with the GUI (clicks, navigation patterns, usage sequences, etc.) can provide valuable data for understanding user behavior or improving user experience.

State Data: The state of the GUI at various points in time can offer insights into how users reach certain states, which can be used to optimize workflows or detect common issues.

Visual Data: If the neural network is designed to work with visual data, screenshots or GUI element properties can be transformed into a format suitable for neural network input. This can be used for tasks like automated GUI testing, layout analysis, or even generating GUI designs.

To facilitate these dual roles, your this.gui package might include different modules or subcomponents dedicated to each function. For instance, one module could focus on providing utility functions and components, while another could handle data extraction and transformation for neural network inputs.

## Usage
Include `this.gui` styles and scripts in your project to utilize the library.

### Including Styles
Link the `this.gui.css` in your HTML or import it in your JavaScript entry file:

In HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/this.gui/dist/this.gui.css">
```

In JavaScript:
```javascript
import 'this.gui/dist/this.gui.css';
```

### Including Scripts
Reference the `this.gui.js` in your HTML or import it if you're using a module bundler:

In HTML:
```html
<script src="/node_modules/this.gui/dist/this.gui.js"></script>
```

In JavaScript:
```javascript
import 'this.gui';
```

## Themes
`this.gui` offers light and dark themes that can be toggled using the `data-theme` attribute:
```html
<body data-theme="dark">
  <!-- Content styled with the dark theme -->
</body>
```

## Components
To use `this.gui` components, add the respective classes to your HTML elements:

```html
<button class="this-gui-button">Click Me</button>
<div class="this-gui-card">
  <h3 class="this-gui-card-title">Card Title</h3>
  <p class="this-gui-card-content">Card content...</p>
</div>
```

Refer to the official [documentation](https://suign.github.io/GUI) for detailed usage instructions and component references.
