Consistent Theming: By wrapping MUI or any other UI framework inside your GUI package, you can set a consistent theme, typography, and other styles that will be common across all the apps where you use this package. This ensures brand consistency.

Custom Components: You can build upon MUI components to create higher-level components tailored for your needs. For instance, you might have a custom UserAvatar component that integrates with your user system or a DataGrid tailored for your backend's data format.

Integrated Logic: The GUI package can contain not just visual components but also logic. For instance, a LoginForm component can have integrated authentication logic that talks to your backend directly. This simplifies the usage in actual apps.

Utilities & Helpers: Apart from components, you can also have utility functions and hooks. For instance, a useUser() hook that fetches and manages the user's state.

Extendability: You can set up your GUI package in a way that while it provides a default theme and behavior, individual projects can customize or extend them as needed.

Version Control: Changes in the UI/UX can be versioned. If you update a component's look or behavior in the GUI package and bump the version, you can choose when to adopt these changes in your various projects by updating the package version.

Documentation: You can maintain a single documentation site/source for your custom GUI package, making it easier for your team (and potentially third-party developers) to understand and use your components.

Dependency Management: With a single GUI package, you can manage the versions of MUI or other dependencies in one place. This can make updates and maintenance easier, especially if breaking changes are introduced in the UI libraries you depend on.
