# ProgressBar Component Guide

The `ProgressBar` component is a flexible UI element used to visually represent progress or completion of a task. It is fully customizable with options for color, progress percentage, and labels, making it suitable for various use cases such as task completion, file uploads, and process tracking.

### Props
- `progress`: The percentage of progress (0-100).
- `color`: The color of the progress bar, supports a wide range of design tokens like `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, etc.
- `label`: Optional label displayed within the progress bar.
- `showLabel`: Boolean to control whether the label is displayed.
- `className`: Additional custom CSS classes.
- `style`: Inline style overrides.

## Use Cases for Progress Bars

### 1. **Task Completion**

The progress bar is ideal for indicating the completion percentage of a task. This is particularly useful in project management or user onboarding scenarios, where visual feedback is required.

#### Example: Task Progress

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ProgressBar } from './ProgressBar';

const TaskProgress = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Task Completion</h3>
      <ProgressBar progress={70} color="success" label="70% Complete" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default TaskProgress;
```

In this example, the progress bar shows that a task is 70% complete with a green `success` color, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

### 2. **File Upload Progress**

Use the progress bar to display the progress of file uploads or downloads, giving users real-time feedback on how much of the upload or download is complete.

#### Example: File Upload Progress

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ProgressBar } from './ProgressBar';

const FileUpload = () => {
  const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState(50);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>File Upload Progress</h3>
      <ProgressBar progress={uploadProgress} color="info" label={`${uploadProgress}%`} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FileUpload;
```

In this example, the `ProgressBar` shows the percentage of a file upload, starting at 50%, and can be dynamically updated as the upload progresses.

---

### 3. **Process Completion**

Progress bars are often used to show the stages of a multi-step process, such as checkout processes, form completion, or wizard-style interfaces.

#### Example: Multi-Step Process

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ProgressBar } from './ProgressBar';

const MultiStepProcess = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Process Completion</h3>
      <ProgressBar progress={40} color="warning" label="Step 2 of 5" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MultiStepProcess;
```

In this scenario, the progress bar indicates that the user is in the second step of a five-step process, with 40% completion.

---

## Customizing the ProgressBar

The `ProgressBar` component can be customized using various props to control its appearance and behavior:

- **Colors**: You can use design token-based colors such as `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `alert`, etc.
- **Labels**: Labels can display specific information inside the progress bar, such as a percentage, step number, or custom text.
- **Progress**: The progress can be dynamically updated as tasks or processes are completed.

### Example: Dynamic Color and Label

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ProgressBar } from './ProgressBar';

const DynamicProgressBar = () => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(30);

  const updateProgress = () => {
    setProgress(prev => (prev < 100 ? prev + 10 : 100));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Dynamic ProgressBar</h3>
      <ProgressBar progress={progress} color={progress >= 100 ? 'success' : 'info'} label={`${progress}%`} />
      <button onClick={updateProgress}>Increase Progress</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DynamicProgressBar;
```

In this example, the progress bar starts at 30%, and each time the button is clicked, the progress increases by 10%. The color changes to `success` when the progress reaches 100%.

## Key Considerations for ProgressBar

### 1. **Visual Feedback**
Progress bars are effective tools for providing real-time visual feedback on task completion or process status. Ensure the progress percentage is accurate and that visual cues (like color changes) are used to indicate completion states.

### 2. **Accessibility**
Consider accessibility by providing text labels and clear descriptions of progress. Use `aria-valuenow` for dynamically updating the progress percentage for screen readers.

### 3. **Customization**
The `ProgressBar` component supports a wide variety of customization options, including colors, labels, and dynamic updates. Ensure that the progress bar fits the overall design and functionality of your application.

## Conclusion

The `ProgressBar` component is a highly versatile tool for visually representing progress across various use cases, including task completion, file uploads, and multi-step processes. By leveraging the flexibility of color schemes, labels, and progress updates, you can create an interactive and engaging user experience.

### Example Usage in a Dashboard:

```jsx
const DashboardProgress = () => {
  const [taskProgress, setTaskProgress] = useState(65);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Dashboard Progress Overview</h3>
      <ProgressBar progress={taskProgress} color="primary" label={`${taskProgress}% Complete`} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

This example shows how a `ProgressBar` can be integrated into a dashboard to track task completion.
