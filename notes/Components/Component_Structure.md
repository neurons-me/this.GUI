1. Component Structure
Component Props: Like the Card component, keep the prop types defined in a standardized way for all components. Clearly define:
Variants (e.g., solid, outline)
Colors (use the same design tokens defined in light.css or other relevant files)
Optional functionality (e.g., expandability, removability)
PropTypes and DefaultProps: Always define PropTypes for validating props and defaultProps to ensure default behavior, making your components more predictable and easier to manage.
State Management: If your components are interactive (like the Card), keep the state management simple and readable, using hooks like useState where necessary.

2. CSS Styling Consistency
CSS Variables: Continue using CSS variables (from light.css) for colors, text sizes, padding, etc. This maintains a unified design language across components.
Hover Effects: If hoverable, include similar hover states for all components, like the Card component, to give consistent visual feedback.
Transitions: Define uniform transition durations and easing for interactive elements across components.

3. Best Practices for Consistency:
Naming Conventions: Use consistent naming for classes and props (__content, __header, isExpandable, isRemovable, etc.). This makes it easier to maintain and expand your codebase.
Responsiveness: Continue implementing media queries where appropriate to ensure that components look good on different devices.
Accessibility: Ensure keyboard accessibility and focus states (:focus) for all interactive components. For example, adding aria-expanded for the accordion would improve accessibility.
4. Component Reusability
Use this design pattern for other components like buttons, modals, or even form inputs. Ensure every component accepts customization options via props, uses the same design tokens for consistency, and keeps functionality modular and reusable.
