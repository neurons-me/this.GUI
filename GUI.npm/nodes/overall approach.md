compact technical brief of the overall approach (props vs config vs viewported configs), with structure, versatility, declarativity, and scope.

1) Plain React props (current/“classic”)

Structure: <Footer title="…" links={[…]} socialLinks={[…]} />
Pros
	•	Familiar React ergonomics.
	•	Strong TypeScript IntelliSense on each prop.
	•	Easy to tree-shake and to reason about in component code.

Cons
	•	Gets verbose as components grow.
	•	Hard to switch “modes” (desktop/mobile/minimal/full) without duplicating prop sets.
	•	Not naturally serializable (harder to hydrate from pure JSON or an external CMS).

Use when
	•	App code writes JSX directly.
	•	Variations are small and local.

2) Single config object

Structure: <Footer config={{ title:"…", links:[…], socialLinks:[…] }} />
Pros
	•	Declarative & serializable: perfect for JSON-driven UIs, CMS/Llama/Lego-style composition.
	•	One entrypoint for “shape evolution”: adding/removing options doesn’t churn the JSX signature.
	•	Easier to diff/patch at runtime (hot updates, remote editing, A/B tests).

Cons
	•	Slightly less IDE precision unless you type config well (e.g., FooterConfig).
	•	If you mix both props and config, you need clear precedence rules.

Use when
	•	You want to drive UI from data (JSON), live-edit, or swap configurations on the fly.
	•	You’re aiming at a “player” model later (render UIs from configs).

Recommended pattern
	•	Support both: keep top-level props for ergonomics, plus an optional config. Component merges: final = { ...defaults, ...config, ...propsOverrides }.

3) Viewport-aware configs (declarative responsiveness)

Structure A (per-prop):
size="pill" or size={{ xs: "icons", md: "pill" }}

Structure B (whole-config overrides):

<StickyOptionsTop
  config={{ items: desktopItems }}
  viewport={{
    xs: { config: { items: mobileItems } },
    sm: { config: { items: mobileItems } }
  }}
/>

(Resolved by your viewport.ts: resolveViewportProp / resolveResponsiveConfig.)

Pros
	•	Responsiveness is data, not scattered useMediaQuery logic.
	•	Plays great with JSON: one base config + sparse overrides per breakpoint.
	•	Testable & SSR-friendly (you can inject a width override).

Cons
	•	Slightly more indirection; you need a tiny resolver layer (which you now have).
	•	Authors must learn the pattern (base + per-breakpoint overrides).

Use when
	•	The same component must present different variants by viewport.
	•	You want a single source of truth for mobile/desktop/XL differences.

Putting it together (recommended architecture)
	•	Component API supports both:
	•	Classic props (ergonomic for app devs).
	•	config (for JSON-driven/declarative scenarios).
	•	Optional viewport to override either specific props or the whole config per breakpoint.
	•	Resolver layer (inside each component):
	1.	Gather defaults.
	2.	Merge config.
	3.	Apply classic prop overrides (if both exist, props win).
	4.	Apply viewport overrides using your resolveViewportProp/resolveResponsiveConfig.
	5.	Render.

This yields:
	•	Versatility: JSX convenience and data-driven control.
	•	Declarativity: All variants can be expressed as JSON and swapped live.
	•	Scope/Future-proofing: Same pattern works for a headless “GUI Player,” CMS, LLM emitters, or Web Components later (just feed the same config/viewport JSON).
	•	Low coupling: Components don’t import useMediaQuery everywhere; the viewport resolver centralizes responsive decisions.

Migration strategy (quick)
	1.	Keep your existing props as-is.
	2.	Add optional config and viewport to priority-merge.
	3.	Start using viewport.ts in 1–2 components (e.g., StickyOptionsTop, Footer) to prove the flow.
	4.	Document the precedence rule: defaults < config < props < viewport overrides.

This gives you the best of all worlds: ergonomic props for developers, clean JSON for declarative UIs, and a compact, testable way to express responsive variants without scattering logic.
