// session (see Spaces.tsx). Kept as one flat nav, not a real /admin URL
// prefix: AppShell's routing is a `.me`-path lookup (app.views[route]), not
// URL-based, so there's no nested-route/param system to hang a literal
// "/admin/:space" on — Spaces.tsx's own selected-space state already gives
// that same effect without inventing one.
