// endpoint is a monad's own base URL, not netget's gateway root —
// local.netget/ serves netget's own admin SPA shell, a different service.
// Routed by name through netget's app-mesh proxy (/apps/<name>) rather than
// a raw port — ports are ephemeral/reassigned per run, the name isn't.
// Points at netget's own monad here purely as a real, reachable example.
//
// namespaceRootUrl is a SEPARATE thing from endpoint, on purpose: endpoint
// is where the row data is fetched FROM (the API), namespaceRootUrl is what
// each row's own identity is displayed/QR'd AS (local.cleaker — the real
// identity root claims made through this gateway resolve under). Omitting
// this previously left getUserHostUrl() fall back to `endpoint` itself,
// which put "local.netget" (the API host) in front of people as if it were
// their namespace root — confusing, and wrong: local.netget never issues
// or resolves identity claims, it only proxies to the monad that does.
